  "frontend/src/index.css": "Global styles with the Silk Splendor brand design system — OKLCH color tokens for crimson, gold, and ivory, Google Fonts imports, and component classes (saree-card, page-header, admin-table-row) rewritten to use plain CSS instead of @apply with opacity modifiers to avoid Tailwind build errors.",
  "frontend/tailwind.config.js": "Extended Tailwind config with brand font families (heading, display, body), custom color tokens (crimson, gold, ivory, teal), silk-themed box shadows, and shimmer animation.",
  "frontend/src/hooks/useQueries.ts": "All React Query hooks for backend operations — `useGetAllSarees` uses `staleTime: 0` and `refetchOnMount: 'always'` for fresh data but no longer sets `gcTime: 0` (which was causing cache entries to be immediately garbage collected, breaking `invalidateQueries`/`refetchQueries` in mutation callbacks); all three saree mutation hooks now use `type: 'active'` in `refetchQueries` to only refetch currently-mounted queries, ensuring the admin list and catalog update immediately after add/edit/delete.",
  "frontend/src/App.tsx": "Main app with TanStack Router — Catalog is the default '/' route; all three admin routes (/admin/sarees, /admin/orders, /admin/customers) are wrapped with OwnerVerificationGate to block unauthorized access.",
  "frontend/src/components/Layout.tsx": "Persistent app shell with sticky header (brand logo showing only \"Pure Silk. Timeless Elegance.\" tagline, conditional admin nav, mobile menu), main content area, and footer — footer brand section now shows \"Tradition Woven in Every Thread\" without the \"Fine Silk Sarees\" prefix.",
  "frontend/src/pages/Catalog.tsx": "Public saree catalog page with hero banner, search/filter/sort controls, and a product grid — now calls `refetch()` on mount via `useEffect` to always load fresh data, shows a background \"Updating…\" indicator during background refetches, and includes a manual refresh button in the filter bar; uses `SareeImage` sub-component with `ExternalBlob.getDirectURL()` for correct image rendering.",
  "frontend/src/pages/AdminSarees.tsx": "Admin saree management page with add/edit modal featuring automatic image compression, upload progress bar, descriptive error messages, and retry-aware loading states — `CompressedImageInfo.bytes` is now typed as `Uint8Array<ArrayBuffer>` and all fallback `arrayBuffer()` calls use explicit `as ArrayBuffer` casts to fix the TypeScript type error.",
  "frontend/src/pages/AdminOrders.tsx": "Admin orders page with extended table showing all columns (Order ID, Customer, Phone, Product Name, Fabric, Color, Qty, Unit Price, Total, Payment Status, Date & Time, Status), color-coded status badges for all five statuses including Cancelled, inline status dropdown, and auto-refresh via the 15-second refetchInterval in useGetAllOrders.",

  "frontend/src/config/constants.ts": "Centralized business config exporting phone numbers, display variants, WhatsApp link, and an `OWNER_PHONE_NUMBERS` array — the alternate phone number (`BUSINESS_PHONE_ALT`) has been updated from `7981324611` to `7981314611` with its display variant updated accordingly.",
  "frontend/src/hooks/useOwnerAuth.ts": "Custom React hook that manages owner phone verification state using sessionStorage — provides `isVerified`, `verifyPhoneNumber` (checks against OWNER_PHONE_NUMBERS), and `clearVerification`.",

  "frontend/src/components/OrderPlacementModal.tsx": "Modal component for placing orders from the catalog — collects customer name, phone, and quantity, shows a product preview, calculates total price, calls usePlaceOrder mutation, invalidates the `orders` React Query cache on success so AdminOrders refreshes immediately, and displays a success confirmation screen with order ID.",
  "frontend/src/utils/imageCompression.ts": "Client-side image compression utility using the Canvas API — all `Uint8Array` types are now explicitly typed as `Uint8Array<ArrayBuffer>` with `as ArrayBuffer` casts on `arrayBuffer()` calls to satisfy the strict TypeScript generic constraint required by `ExternalBlob.fromBytes`.",
  "frontend/src/utils/retryWithBackoff.ts": "New utility module providing a generic `retryWithBackoff` async wrapper with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s delays, up to 3 attempts) and a `parseBackendError` helper that converts raw backend errors into user-friendly messages distinguishing image-too-large, unauthorized, timeout, and network failures."
