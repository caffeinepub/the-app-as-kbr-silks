  "frontend/src/hooks/useQueries.ts": "All React Query hooks for backend operations — saree mutation hooks (`useAddSaree`, `useUpdateSaree`, `useDeleteSaree`) now only check `!actor` (not `actorFetching`) before invoking backend methods, preventing false \"still initializing\" errors when the actor is available but a background refetch is in progress.",
  "frontend/src/App.tsx": "Main app with TanStack Router — adds a `/admin` redirect route that sends users to `/admin/sarees`, alongside the existing catalog route at `/` and all three admin routes wrapped with `OwnerVerificationGate`.",

  "frontend/src/pages/AdminSarees.tsx": "Admin saree management page where the \"Add Saree\" button is now always enabled (never disabled by actor loading state) so clicking it always opens the modal — actor readiness is checked only at form submission time, not at button click time.",
  "frontend/src/pages/AdminOrders.tsx": "Admin orders page with extended table showing all columns (Order ID, Customer, Phone, Product Name, Fabric, Color, Qty, Unit Price, Total, Payment Status, Date & Time, Status), color-coded status badges for all five statuses including Cancelled, inline status dropdown, and auto-refresh via the 15-second refetchInterval in useGetAllOrders.",

  "frontend/src/utils/imageCompression.ts": "Client-side image compression utility that returns `Uint8Array<ArrayBuffer>` (explicit generic) by casting `arrayBuffer as ArrayBuffer` before constructing the typed array, ensuring the return type is compatible with `ExternalBlob.fromBytes()`.",
  "frontend/src/utils/retryWithBackoff.ts": "Generic `retryWithBackoff` async wrapper with exponential backoff (up to 3 attempts) and an updated `parseBackendError` helper that now explicitly maps the \"Expected v3 response body\" IC agent error to a clear user-friendly message about network issues."
