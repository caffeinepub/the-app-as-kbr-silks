## Summary
**Goal:** Update the alternate contact phone number in the app's business configuration to 7981314611.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the alternate phone number constant in `frontend/src/config/constants.ts` to `7981314611`
- Ensure all UI locations (header, footer, contact info sections) that display the alternate contact number reflect the new value

**User-visible outcome:** The alternate contact number shown throughout the app now displays 7981314611, while the primary phone number and WhatsApp link remain unchanged.
