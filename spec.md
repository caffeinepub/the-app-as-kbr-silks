# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Fix the non-functional "Add Saree" button in the AdminSarees page so it correctly opens the add saree modal form.

**Planned changes:**
- Fix the "Add Saree" button in AdminSarees so it becomes enabled and responsive once the actor is initialized
- Ensure clicking the button opens the saree creation modal form
- Ensure submitting the modal form successfully calls the addSaree mutation

**User-visible outcome:** Admin users can click the "Add Saree" button to open the modal form and successfully add new sarees to the catalog.
