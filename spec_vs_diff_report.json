  "summary": "The diff implements the fix for the 'Add Saree' button in AdminSarees. The button is now always enabled (not disabled by actor loading state), actor readiness is checked only at form submission time, and the useQueries hooks were updated to only check !actor (not actorFetching) before invoking backend methods. All acceptance criteria for REQ-1 appear to be addressed.",
