  "summary": "The diff updates BUSINESS_PHONE_ALT in frontend/src/config/constants.ts from '7981324611' to '7981314611' and updates its display variant accordingly. The primary phone number (BUSINESS_PHONE) and WhatsApp link remain unchanged. The OWNER_PHONE_NUMBERS array also includes the updated number. No files under frontend/src/hooks/ were modified. The requirements appear to be satisfied, though the diff summary for UI components (Layout.tsx, etc.) does not explicitly confirm the alternate number propagation to header/footer — however, since the number is sourced from the centralized constants file, UI propagation is implied by the architecture.",
