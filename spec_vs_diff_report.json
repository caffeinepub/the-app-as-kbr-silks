  "summary": "The diff implements all three requirements. REQ-1 is addressed by adding invalidateQueries + refetchQueries in useAddSaree and useUpdateSaree onSuccess handlers. REQ-2 is addressed by introducing a shared QUERY_KEYS constant with staleTime:0/gcTime:0/refetchOnMount:'always' in useGetAllSarees, used consistently across pages. REQ-3 is addressed by the SareeImage component in Catalog.tsx using ExternalBlob.getDirectURL() for proper image rendering. All acceptance criteria appear to be met.",
