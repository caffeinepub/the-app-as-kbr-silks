  "summary": "The diff shows modifications to backend/main.mo and project_state.json. The project_state.json only updates metadata/status fields. The backend/main.mo is truncated and shows structural changes (AccessControl module, MixinAuthorization mixin included), but the critical addSaree function body is cut off in the truncation. There is no evidence of any frontend changes (e.g., AdminSarees page). Both requirements appear to be either incomplete or unverifiable from the diff.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Fix the frontend AdminSarees page to ensure the addSaree mutation passes the correct caller identity or auth context that the backend expects.",
      "reason": "No frontend files were modified in the diff. The AdminSarees page and any related frontend auth context changes are completely absent.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Fix the backend authorization check in the addSaree function so that users authenticated via the secondary admin password ('9966') or authorized phone numbers are correctly recognized as admins and allowed to add sarees.",
      "reason": "The backend/main.mo is truncated before the addSaree function body is visible. While AccessControl and MixinAuthorization are imported/used, there is no evidence that the addSaree authorization logic was actually changed to accept password/phone-based admin sessions. The fix cannot be confirmed.",
