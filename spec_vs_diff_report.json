  "summary": "The diff implements fixes for React Query cache invalidation in useQueries.ts, addressing all three requirements. The saree mutation hooks (addSaree, updateSaree, deleteSaree) now include onSuccess callbacks that call both invalidateQueries and refetchQueries with the unified QUERY_KEYS.sarees key. staleTime is set to 0 and gcTime is no longer set to 0 (fixing the cache garbage collection issue). The Catalog page also calls refetch() on mount. All requirements appear to be implemented.",

    {
      "description": "Catalog page calls refetch() on mount via useEffect and shows a background 'Updating…' indicator during background refetches, plus a manual refresh button in the filter bar.",
      "reason": "The build request did not ask for a manual refresh button or a visual 'Updating…' background indicator in the Catalog page. These are extra UI features not requested.",
