Review the button's disabled state logic to ensure it properly reflects actor availability from the useActor hook. Ensure the onClick handler correctly sets the modal state to open the add saree form. Verify that the button is not inadvertently disabled by loading states from React Query hooks (useGetAllSarees) that should not affect the add button's availability."
